## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Execution Model

```
Top-to-Bottom Processing, Inside-Out Dependency Resolution
    ↓
Waitlist sorted by flow index (1 → 1.1 → 1.2 → ...)
    ↓
Child inferences complete before parents
    ↓
Parent inferences wait for all inputs
    ↓
Ready inferences execute immediately
```

### The Three Systems

| System | Purpose | Key Component |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Reference System** | Data storage | Multi-dimensional tensors with named axes |
| **Agent Sequences** | Step execution | Pre-defined pipelines (semantic + syntactic) |
| **Orchestrator** | Flow control | Dependency manager + status tracker |

### Semantic vs. Syntactic

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SEMANTIC SEQUENCES                             │
│  → CREATE information via LLM/tools             │
│  → Expensive (tokens), non-deterministic        │
│  → Imperative, Judgement                       │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SYNTACTIC SEQUENCES                            │
│  → RESHAPE information via tensor algebra       │
│  → Free, deterministic, auditable              │
│  → Assigning, Grouping, Timing, Looping        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 💡 The Big Picture

### Data Flow

```
1. Concept declared in plan
      ↓
2. Reference initialized in ConceptRepo
      ↓
3. Child inferences execute
      ↓
4. Child results stored as References
      ↓
5. Parent inference retrieves input References (IR)
      ↓
6. Syntactic operations reshape References
      ↓
7. Semantic operations perceive signs → actual data (MVP)
      ↓
8. Tool/paradigm applies function to data (TVA)
      ↓
9. Result stored as new Reference (OR)
      ↓
10. Blackboard updated, cycle continues
```

### Execution Loop

```
CYCLE 1:
  Check readiness → Execute ready items → Update Blackboard
  
CYCLE 2:
  Check readiness → Execute ready items → Update Blackboard
  
...

CYCLE N:
  All complete → Return final results
```

### References Are Tensors

```
Reference for {student grades}
    axes=['student', 'assignment']
    shape=(3, 4)
    tensor=[
        [85, 90, 88, 92],
        [78, 88, 85, 90],
        [92, 95, 93, 98]
    ]
```

**Named axes** enable meaningful operations:
- `grades.get(student=0)` → all assignments for student 0
- `grades.slice('student')` → aggregate across assignments

## 📖 Common Questions

**Q: How does the orchestrator know which step to run next?**  
A: It scans the Waitlist for inferences whose dependencies (children + inputs) are all complete.

**Q: What's the difference between semantic and syntactic sequences?**  
A: Semantic sequences call LLMs (expensive, non-deterministic). Syntactic sequences manipulate tensors (free, deterministic).

**Q: How are References different from regular variables?**  
A: References are multi-dimensional tensors with named axes. They support rich operations like cross products and slicing.

**Q: What happens when a loop runs?**  
A: The Quantifier manages a workspace, resets child inferences after each iteration, and aggregates results at completion.

**Q: How do I resume from a checkpoint?**  
A: Use `Orchestrator.load_checkpoint(..., mode="PATCH")` which re-runs only changed logic.

**Q: What are perceptual signs?**  
A: Formatted strings like `%{file_location}7f2(data/input.txt)` that tell agents how to retrieve actual data. They enable lazy loading.

**Q: How do `@:'` conditions work?**  
A: The Timing sequence checks the condition's boolean value. If not met, the inference and all its children are marked "skipped".

**Q: Can I inspect what each step saw?**  
A: Yes! Check the Reference for any concept in the ConceptRepo. Everything is explicit and traceable.

## 🚀 Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Basic Execution

**Python API**:

from infra._orchestrator import Orchestrator
from infra._core import ConceptRepo, InferenceRepo

# Load repositories
concept_repo = ConceptRepo.from_file('concepts.json')
inference_repo = InferenceRepo.from_file('inferences.json')

# Create orchestrator
orchestrator = Orchestrator(concept_repo, inference_repo)

# Execute
final_concepts = orchestrator.run()

# Get result
result_ref = concept_repo.get_reference('{final result}')
print(result_ref.tensor)
```

**CLI**:
```bash
python cli_orchestrator.py run \
    --concepts concepts.json \
    --inferences inferences.json \
    --inputs inputs.json
```

---

### Example 2: Resume from Checkpoint

**Python API**:
```python
# Resume in PATCH mode (re-run changed logic)
orchestrator = Orchestrator.load_checkpoint(
    concept_repo,
    inference_repo,
    mode="PATCH"
)

# Continue execution
orchestrator.run()
```

**CLI**:
```bash
# Resume latest run
python cli_orchestrator.py resume \
    --concepts concepts.json \
    --inferences inferences.json

# Resume specific run

    --concepts concepts.json \
    --inferences inferences.json \
    --run-id abc123...
```

---

### Example 3: Inspect References

```python
# Get concept's Reference
ref = concept_repo.get_reference('{intermediate result}')

# Inspect structure
print(f"Axes: {ref.axes}")
print(f"Shape: {ref.shape}")
print(f"Tensor: {ref.tensor}")

# Get clean data (skip values removed)
clean_data = ref.get_tensor(ignore_skip=True)
```

---

### Example 4: Check Status

```python
# Check inference status
status = orchestrator.blackboard.get_status(flow_index='1.2.1')
print(f"Inference 1.2.1: {status}")

# Check concept readiness
is_ready = orchestrator.blackboard.is_concept_ready('{input A}')
print(f"Input A ready: {is_ready}")

# Get execution history
history = orchestrator.process_tracker.get_history()
for cycle in history:
    print(f"Cycle {cycle['number']}: {len(cycle['executed'])} executed")
```

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### The Execution Promise

**NormCode's execution enforces data isolation by design**:

1. **Inside-out resolution**: Can't run until children/inputs ready
2. **Reference isolation**: Each concept has its own tensor
3. **Explicit retrieval**: IR step fetches only declared inputs
4. **No hidden state**: Everything tracked in Blackboard
5. **Full auditability**: Inspect exactly what each step saw

### Performance Characteristics

| Type | Cost | Deterministic | Cacheable |
|------|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Semantic** | Tokens | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (via checkpoints) |
| **Syntactic** | ~0 | ✅ Yes | N/A (instant) |

### Debugging Strategy

```
1. Check Blackboard → What's the status?
2. Check References → What data was present?
3. Check ProcessTracker → What happened during execution?
4. Check dependencies → Why isn't an inference ready?
5. Check workspace → What's the loop state?
```
