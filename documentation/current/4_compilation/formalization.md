# Formalization

**Phase 2: Adding structural rigor—flow indices, sequence types, and bindings.**

---

## Overview

**Formalization** is the second phase of NormCode compilation. It transforms the draft `.ncds` format into rigorous `.ncd` (NormCode Draft) with complete structural annotations.

**Input**: `.ncds` (draft straightforward)  
**Output**: `.ncd` (formal) with flow indices and sequence types

**Core Task**: Remove ambiguity by adding explicit structural metadata.

---

## What Formalization Adds

### The Four Key Additions

| Addition | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Flow Indices** | Unique addresses for each step | `?{flow_index}: 1.2.3` |
| **Sequence Types** | Operation classification | `?{sequence}: imperative` |
| **Semantic Types** | Concept classification | `{}`, `[]`, `<>`, `::()`, etc. |
| **Value Bindings** | Input ordering | `<:{1}>`, `<:{2}>`, `<:{3}>` |

---

## Flow Indices

### Purpose

**Flow indices** are hierarchical addresses that uniquely identify every step in the plan.

**Format**: `1.2.3.4...` where each number is a level in the tree.

### Generation Rules

1. **Start at root**: Root concept gets `1`
2. **Increment within level**: Siblings get sequential numbers
3. **Nest for children**: Children append `.1`, `.2`, `.3`, etc.
4. **All concept lines get indices**: Including `<=`, `<-`, `<*`, and `:<:`

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Sibling Pattern

**This is the most common source of bugs.** Value concepts that are inputs to a functional concept are **siblings** of that functional, NOT children of it.

```
CORRECT PATTERN:
1.2      - {parent value}           (depth 2)
  1.2.1  - <= (functional)          (depth 3) - ALWAYS .1
  1.2.2  - {input1}                 (depth 3) - sibling of functional
  1.2.3  - {input2}                 (depth 3) - sibling of functional
    1.2.3.1 - <= (child functional) (depth 4) - child's .1
    1.2.3.2 - <source>              (depth 4) - sibling of child functional
  1.2.4  - {input3}                 (depth 3) - sibling of functional

WRONG PATTERN (causes bugs):
1.2      - {parent value}
  1.2.1  - <= (functional)
    1.2.1.1  - {input1}  ← WRONG! Should be 1.2.2
    1.2.1.2  - {input2}  ← WRONG! Should be 1.2.3
```

**Rules:**
1. **Functional concept is always `.1`** - The operator/imperative/judgement is the first child
2. **Same depth = same index length** - All siblings have indices with the same number of parts
3. **Value concepts are siblings, not children** - Inputs to a functional are at the same depth as the functional
4. **Each functional can have its own child tree** - Nested inferences follow the same pattern recursively

### Example

**Input (`.ncds`)**:
```ncds
<- result
    <= calculate
    <- input A
        <= process A
        <- raw A
    <- input B
        <= process B
        <- raw B
```

**Output (`.ncd` with flow indices)**:
```ncd
:<:{result} | ?{flow_index}: 1
    <= ::(calculate) | ?{flow_index}: 1.1
    <- {input A} | ?{flow_index}: 1.2
        <= ::(process A) | ?{flow_index}: 1.2.1
        <- {raw A} | ?{flow_index}: 1.2.2
    <- {input B} | ?{flow_index}: 1.3
        <= ::(process B) | ?{flow_index}: 1.3.1
        <- {raw B} | ?{flow_index}: 1.3.2
```

**Note:** `{raw A}` is `1.2.2` (sibling of `1.2.1`), NOT `1.2.1.1` (child of `1.2.1`).

### Reading Flow Indices

**`1.2.3` means**:
- `1` - First root concept
- `.2` - Second child of root
- `.3` - Third child of that concept

**Properties**:
- **Unique**: Each step has exactly one flow index
- **Hierarchical**: Parent-child relationships are clear
- **Ordered**: Execution can follow index order (with dependency resolution)

### Why Flow Indices Matter

| Use Case | How Flow Indices Help |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Debugging** | "Step 1.3.2 failed" tells you exactly where |
| **Checkpointing** | Resume from specific index |
| **Cross-referencing** | Reference other steps explicitly |
| **Dependency tracking** | Orchestrator knows execution order |
| **Logging** | Detailed execution traces |

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Explicit Input References for Operators

**Problem:** When an operator (like `$.` specification) references a concept, that concept MUST be declared as a sibling value concept. Otherwise, the scheduler doesn't know about the dependency.

**Symptom:** Value concept shows "empty" status even though the source is "complete".

**WRONG - Missing input reference:**
```ncd
<- {AOC validity} | ?{flow_index}: 1.7.3
    <= $. %>(<AOC is valid>) | ?{flow_index}: 1.7.3.1 | ?{sequence}: assigning
    /: BUG: <AOC is valid> is referenced but not declared!
```

**CORRECT - Explicit input reference:**
```ncd
<- {AOC validity} | ?{flow_index}: 1.7.3
    <= $. %>(<AOC is valid>) | ?{flow_index}: 1.7.3.1 | ?{sequence}: assigning
    <- <AOC is valid> | ?{flow_index}: 1.7.3.2
```

**Rule:** Every operator must explicitly declare its inputs as sibling value concepts. This creates the dependency edge in the execution graph.

### Deprecated Pattern

> **Note**: Older NormCode versions marked flow_index only on functional concepts (`<=`). Current practice marks **every concept line** for complete traceability.

**Old (deprecated)**:
```ncd
:<:{result}
    <= ::(calculate) | ?{flow_index}: 1
    <- {input}
```

**New (current)**:
```ncd
:<:{result} | ?{flow_index}: 1
    <= ::(calculate) | ?{flow_index}: 1.1
    <- {input} | ?{flow_index}: 1.2
```

---

## Sequence Types

### Purpose

**Sequence types** classify operations to determine execution strategy.

### The Two Categories

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SEMANTIC SEQUENCES                              │
│  → CREATE information via LLM/tools              │
│  → Expensive (tokens), non-deterministic         │
│  → imperative, judgement                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SYNTACTIC SEQUENCES                             │
│  → RESHAPE information via tensor algebra        │
│  → Free, deterministic, auditable               │
│  → assigning, grouping, timing, looping         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Sequence Type Detection

**Rule**: Analyze the functional concept syntax to determine sequence type.

| Functional Concept Pattern | Sequence Type | Category |
|----------------------------|---------------|----------|
| `::()` or `({})` | `imperative` | Semantic |
| `::<>` or `<{}>` | `judgement` | Semantic |
| `$=`, `$.`, `$+`, `$-`, `$%` | `assigning` | Syntactic |
| `&[{}]`, `&[#]` | `grouping` | Syntactic |
| `@:'`, `@:!`, `@.` | `timing` | Syntactic |
| `*.` | `looping` | Syntactic |

**Priority**: Check for syntactic operators FIRST (more specific), then fall back to semantic patterns.

### Example

**Input (`.ncds`)**:
```ncds
<- result
    <= calculate sum
    <- numbers
        <= collect all numbers
        <- number A
        <- number B
```

**Output (`.ncd` with sequences)**:
```ncd
:<:{result} | ?{flow_index}: 1
    <= ::(calculate sum) | ?{flow_index}: 1.1 | ?{sequence}: imperative
    <- {numbers} | ?{flow_index}: 1.2
        <= &[#] | ?{flow_index}: 1.2.1 | ?{sequence}: grouping
        <- {number A} | ?{flow_index}: 1.2.1.1
        <- {number B} | ?{flow_index}: 1.2.1.2
```

**Explanation**:
- `calculate sum` → `imperative` (semantic operation, calls LLM)
- `collect all numbers` → Recognized as grouping, transformed to `&[#]` → `grouping` sequence

### Implicit Operator Recognition

Formalization can **recognize natural language patterns** and convert them to operators:

| NL Pattern | Recognized As | Operator |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| "collect all X" | Grouping | `&[#]` |
| "combine X and Y" | Grouping | `&[{}]` |
| "for each X" | Looping | `*.` |
| "if condition" | Timing | `@:'` |
| "select first valid" | Assigning | `$.` |

---

## Semantic Types

### Purpose

**Semantic types** classify concepts by their nature (object, relation, proposition, etc.).

### The Type System

| Symbol | Type | Description | Examples |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|
| `{}` | Object | Singular entity | `{document}`, `{result}` |
| `[]` | Relation | Collection | `[numbers]`, `[files]` |
| `<>` | Proposition | Boolean state | `<is valid>`, `<ready>` |
| `:S:` | Subject | Agent/actor | `:LLM:`, `:Agent:` |
| `::()` | Imperative | Command/action | `::(calculate)` |
| `::<>` | Judgement | Evaluation | `::(is valid)<ALL True>` |

### Type Inference Rules

**For value concepts** (`<-`):

1. **Singular nouns** → `{}` (Object)
   - "document", "result", "value"
2. **Plural nouns or "all X"** → `[]` (Relation)
   - "documents", "all numbers", "files"
3. **Boolean/state phrases** → `<>` (Proposition)
   - "is valid", "passed", "ready"

**For functional concepts** (`<=`):

1. **Action verbs** → `::()` (Imperative)
   - "calculate", "extract", "process"
2. **Evaluation phrases** → `::<>` (Judgement)
   - "is valid", "meets criteria", "passes test"
3. **Syntactic operators** → Keep operator syntax
   - `$.`, `&[{}]`, `@:'`, `*.`

### Example

**Input (`.ncds`)**:
```ncds
<- validation result
    <= check if input is valid
    <- input data
```

**Output (`.ncd` with types)**:
```ncd
:<:{validation result} | ?{flow_index}: 1
    <= ::(check if input is valid)<ALL True> | ?{flow_index}: 1.1 | ?{sequence}: judgement
    <- {input data} | ?{flow_index}: 1.2
```

**Explanation**:
- `validation result` → `{}` (singular object)
- `check if input is valid` → Recognized as judgement, gets `::<>` and truth assertion
- `input data` → `{}` (singular object)

---

## Value Bindings

### Purpose

**Value bindings** explicitly order multi-input operations to remove ambiguity.

### The Problem

**Ambiguous**:
```ncd
<= ::(divide A and B)
<- {number A}
<- {number B}
```

**Question**: Which is dividend and which is divisor?

### The Solution: Value Placement

**Syntax**: `<:{N}>` on value concepts

**Example**:
```ncd
<= ::(divide {1} by {2})
<- {number A}<:{1}>
<- {number B}<:{2}>
```

**Now clear**: A is {1} (dividend), B is {2} (divisor)

### Extraction and Assignment

**During formalization**:

1. **Scan functional concept** for placeholders: `{1}`, `{2}`, `{3}`, etc.
2. **Match with value concepts** in order
3. **Add bindings** `<:{N}>` to value concepts

**Example**:

**Input (`.ncds`)**:
```ncds
<- result
    <= sum A and B to get result
    <- number A
    <- number B
    <- result placeholder
```

**Formalization detects** "A and B to get result" pattern:

**Output (`.ncd`)**:
```ncd
:<:{result} | ?{flow_index}: 1
    <= ::(sum {1} and {2} to get {3}) | ?{flow_index}: 1.1 | ?{sequence}: imperative
    <- {number A}<:{1}> | ?{flow_index}: 1.2
    <- {number B}<:{2}> | ?{flow_index}: 1.3
    <- {result}<:{3}> | ?{flow_index}: 1.4
```

### Advanced Binding: Instance Markers

**For more complex references**:

| Marker | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `<$()%>` | Instance marker (in functional concepts) | `{1}<$({input})%>` |
| `<$()=>` | Identifier marker | `{result}<$({version})=>` |

See [Grammar/Complete Syntax Reference](../2_grammar/complete_syntax_reference.md) for details.

---

## Root Concept Marker

### The `:<:` Marker

The **root concept** (final output) uses special marker `:<:`:

**Before formalization**:
```ncds
<- final result
    <= compute
    <- input
```

**After formalization**:
```ncd
:<:{final result} | ?{flow_index}: 1
    <= ::(compute) | ?{flow_index}: 1.1 | ?{sequence}: imperative
    <- {input} | ?{flow_index}: 1.2
```

**Purpose**:
- Marks the top-level goal
- Identifies the final output
- Used by orchestrator to know what to return

---

## Complete Formalization Example

### Before: `.ncds`

```ncds
<- investment decision
    <= synthesize recommendation
    <- risk analysis
        <= analyze risk
        <- price data
        <= validate signals
        <- market signals
    <- sentiment score
        <= analyze sentiment
        <- news articles
```

### After: `.ncd`

```ncd
:<:{investment decision} | ?{flow_index}: 1
    <= ::(synthesize recommendation from {1} and {2}) | ?{flow_index}: 1.1 | ?{sequence}: imperative
    <- {risk analysis}<:{1}> | ?{flow_index}: 1.2
        <= ::(analyze risk based on {1} given {2}) | ?{flow_index}: 1.2.1 | ?{sequence}: imperative
        <- {price data}<:{1}> | ?{flow_index}: 1.2.2
        <- <signals validated><:{2}> | ?{flow_index}: 1.2.3
            <= ::(validate signals)<ALL True> | ?{flow_index}: 1.2.3.1 | ?{sequence}: judgement
            <- {market signals} | ?{flow_index}: 1.2.3.2
    <- {sentiment score}<:{2}> | ?{flow_index}: 1.3
        <= ::(analyze sentiment) | ?{flow_index}: 1.3.1 | ?{sequence}: imperative
        <- {news articles} | ?{flow_index}: 1.3.2
```

### What Changed

1. ✅ Flow indices on every line
2. ✅ Sequence types determined
3. ✅ Semantic types added (`{}`, `<>`, `::()`, `::<>`)
4. ✅ Value bindings added (`<:{1}>`, `<:{2}>`)
5. ✅ Root marked with `:<:`
6. ✅ Truth assertion added to judgement (`<ALL True>`)
7. ✅ **Sibling pattern**: `{market signals}` is `1.2.3.2` (sibling of `1.2.3.1`), NOT `1.2.3.1.1`
8. ✅ **Sibling pattern**: `{news articles}` is `1.3.2` (sibling of `1.3.1`), NOT `1.3.1.1`

## Formalization Rules Summary

### Flow Index Assignment

```
1. Start at 1 for root
2. Functional concept is ALWAYS .1 (first child)
3. Value concept inputs are siblings (.2, .3, .4, ...)
4. NEVER nest value concepts under functional concepts
5. Grandchild functional is X.Y.Z.1, its inputs are X.Y.Z.2, X.Y.Z.3, etc.
```

**Visual Pattern:**
```
X.Y      - {parent}
  X.Y.1  - <= (functional)    ← Always .1
  X.Y.2  - {input1}           ← Sibling, NOT X.Y.1.1
  X.Y.3  - {input2}           ← Sibling, NOT X.Y.1.2
    X.Y.3.1 - <= (nested)     ← Child's functional is .1
    X.Y.3.2 - {nested input}  ← Sibling of nested functional
```

### Sequence Type Assignment

```
1. Check for syntactic operators ($, &, @, *)
2. If none, check semantic patterns (::(), ::<>)
3. Assign appropriate sequence type
4. Add to ?{sequence}: comment
```

### Semantic Type Assignment

```
1. Analyze concept name (singular/plural/boolean)
2. Assign {} for objects, [] for relations, <> for propositions
3. For functional concepts, use ::() or ::<>
4. Add truth assertions to judgements
```

### Value Binding Assignment

```
1. Scan functional concept for placeholders
2. Match placeholders to value concepts in order
3. Add <:{N}> markers to value concepts
4. Ensure consistency
```

### Explicit Input References

```
1. Every operator ($., &[], *., etc.) must declare its inputs
2. Inputs are sibling value concepts under the same parent
3. This creates dependency edges in the execution graph
4. Missing references cause "empty" status bugs at runtime
```

## Formalization Tools

### Automated Formalization

**Command**:
```bash
python compiler.py formalize draft.ncds
```

**Output**: `draft.ncd` with all formalizations applied

### Manual Formalization

**Steps**:
1. Copy `.ncds` content
2. Add flow indices (start at 1, follow rules)
3. Determine sequence types for each `<=`
4. Add semantic types to concepts
5. Add value bindings where needed
6. Mark root with `:<:`
7. Validate with checklist

---

## Formalization vs. Post-Formalization

### What Formalization Does

- ✅ Adds flow indices
- ✅ Determines sequence types
- ✅ Assigns semantic types
- ✅ Creates value bindings
- ✅ Marks root concept

### What Formalization Does NOT Do

- ❌ Add paradigm configurations (that's Post-Formalization)
- ❌ Link to resources (that's Post-Formalization)
- ❌ Specify axes and shapes (that's Post-Formalization)
- ❌ Generate working_interpretation (that's Activation)

**Formalization focuses on STRUCTURE, not EXECUTION.**

---

## Combined Formalization + Post-Formalization

### When to Combine

In practice, formalization and post-formalization are often done **simultaneously**, especially when:

1. **Building `.pf.ncd` directly** - Skip intermediate `.ncd` file
2. **Iterating on a workflow** - Easier to see complete picture
3. **Complex operators** - Annotations needed to understand structure
4. **LLM-assisted generation** - AI can produce fully annotated plans

### Combined Workflow

```
_.ncds (Draft)
    ↓ Combined Formalization + Post-Formalization
_.pf.ncd (Post-Formalized, ready for activation)
    ↓ _.activate_nci.py
repos/concept_repo.json + repos/inference_repo.json
```

### Example: Combined Output

Instead of two separate steps, produce `.pf.ncd` directly:

```ncd
:<:{result} | ?{flow_index}: 1
    <= ::(calculate sum) | ?{flow_index}: 1.1 | ?{sequence}: imperative
        | %{norm_input}: v_PromptLocation-h_Literal-c_GenerateThinkJson-o_Literal
        | %{v_input_provision}: provisions/prompts/calculate.md
    <- {input A}<:{1}> | ?{flow_index}: 1.2
        | %{ref_axes}: [_none_axis]
        | %{ref_element}: int
    <- {input B}<:{2}> | ?{flow_index}: 1.3
        | %{ref_axes}: [_none_axis]
        | %{ref_element}: int
```

### Benefits of Combined Approach

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fewer files** | No intermediate `.ncd` to maintain |
| **Complete context** | See structure and configuration together |
| **Faster iteration** | One edit, not two |
| **Better AI generation** | LLMs can produce fully-specified plans |

### When to Keep Separate

Keep formalization and post-formalization separate when:

1. **Learning NormCode** - Understand each phase clearly
2. **Debugging complex plans** - Isolate structural vs. configuration issues
3. **Reusing structures** - Same `.ncd` with different configurations
4. **Team workflows** - Different people handle structure vs. resources

---

## Next Steps

After formalization, your `.ncd` file moves to:

- **[Post-Formalization](post_formalization.md)** - Add norms, resources, and execution configuration

---

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

| Concept | Insight |
|---------|---------|
| **Flow indices** | Unique hierarchical addresses for every step |
| **⚠️ Sibling pattern** | Functional is `.1`, inputs are `.2`, `.3`, `.4` (NEVER `.1.1`, `.1.2`) |
| **⚠️ Explicit references** | Operators MUST declare inputs as sibling value concepts |
| **Sequence types** | Classify operations as semantic (LLM) or syntactic (free) |
| **Semantic types** | Classify concepts by nature (object, relation, proposition) |
| **Value bindings** | Remove ambiguity in multi-input operations |
| **Combined workflow** | Formalization + post-formalization can be done simultaneously |

### The Two Most Common Bugs

**1. Wrong Flow Index Nesting**
```
WRONG: 1.2.1 (functional) → 1.2.1.1 (input)
RIGHT: 1.2.1 (functional) → 1.2.2 (input)
```

**2. Missing Input References**
```
WRONG: <= $. %>(<source>) with no sibling <source> declared
RIGHT: <= $. %>(<source>) + <- <source> as sibling
```

### The Formalization Promise

**Formalization removes ambiguity**:

1. Vague `.ncds` becomes precise `.ncd` (or `.pf.ncd` if combined)
2. Every step has unique identity
3. Execution strategy is clear
4. Data flow is explicit
5. Dependencies are correctly captured
6. Ready for configuration (or execution if combined)

**Result**: A plan with rigorous structure, ready for execution configuration.

**Ready to configure execution?** Continue to [Post-Formalization](post_formalization.md) to enrich your plan with norms and resources.

**Or combine both phases** and produce `.pf.ncd` directly for faster iteration.
