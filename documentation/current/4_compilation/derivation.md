# Derivation

**Phase 1: Transforming natural language into hierarchical inference structure.**

---

## Overview

**Derivation** is the first phase of NormCode compilation. It transforms unstructured natural language instructions into a hierarchical tree of inferences using the `.ncds` (NormCode Draft Straightforward) format.

**Input**: Natural language instruction  
**Output**: `.ncds` file with hierarchical structure

**Core Task**: Extract concepts (data), operations (actions), and their dependencies from natural language.

---

## The Derivation Problem

### Why Derivation Is Needed

Natural language is ambiguous and unstructured:

```
"Analyze the sentiment of customer reviews after filtering out spam and duplicates."
```

**Questions that need answering**:
- What are the data entities? (reviews, sentiment scores, spam markers)
- What are the operations? (filter spam, remove duplicates, analyze sentiment)
- What's the dependency order? (filter first, then deduplicate, then analyze)
- Which concepts depend on which? (sentiment analysis needs clean reviews)

**Derivation resolves these ambiguities** by creating explicit structure.

---

## The `.ncds` Format

### Basic Structure

`.ncds` (NormCode Draft Straightforward) uses minimal markers to express hierarchical inferences:

| Marker | Name | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `<-` | Value Concept | Data (inputs and outputs) |
| `<=` | Functional Concept | Operations to execute |
| `<*` | Context Concept | Loop state or context data (optional) |

### Reading Direction

**Bottom-up execution**: Read from deepest concepts upward.

**Example**:
```ncds
<- final result
    <= calculate sum
    <- processed data
        <= clean the data
        <- raw data
```

**Execution order**:
1. Start with `raw data`
2. Run `clean the data` → produces `processed data`
3. Run `calculate sum` → produces `final result`

### Indentation

**4-space indentation** indicates hierarchy:
- 0 spaces: Root concept
- 4 spaces: Children of root
- 8 spaces: Grandchildren
- etc.

---

## Extraction Process

### Step 1: Identify Concepts

**Goal**: Extract all data entities mentioned in the natural language.

**Patterns to look for**:
- Nouns and noun phrases
- "the X", "a Y", "all Z"
- Input/output mentions
- Intermediate results

**Example**:

**Input**: "Summarize the document after extracting the main content."

**Identified Concepts**:
- `document` (input)
- `main content` (intermediate)
- `summary` (output)

### Step 2: Identify Operations

**Goal**: Extract all actions/operations mentioned.

**Patterns to look for**:
- Verbs and verb phrases
- "calculate", "extract", "analyze", "filter", "transform"
- Imperatives ("do X", "compute Y")

**Example**:

**Input**: "Summarize the document after extracting the main content."

**Identified Operations**:
- `extract the main content`
- `summarize`

### Step 3: Determine Dependencies

**Goal**: Figure out which concepts feed into which operations.

**Rules**:
- Temporal order ("after X, do Y" → X comes before Y)
- Data flow ("analyze the cleaned data" → clean first)
- Hierarchical nesting (child inferences produce parent inputs)

**Example**:

**Input**: "Summarize the document after extracting the main content."

**Dependencies**:
1. `extract the main content` depends on `document`
2. `summarize` depends on result of extraction
3. Final output is `summary`

### Step 4: Build Hierarchical Structure

**Goal**: Arrange concepts and operations in bottom-up tree.

**Algorithm**:
1. Start with final output (root)
2. For each concept, add its operation as child
3. For each operation, add its inputs as children
4. Recurse until all concepts placed

**Example**:

**Input**: "Summarize the document after extracting the main content."

**Output (`.ncds`)**:
```ncds
<- document summary
    <= summarize this text
    <- main content
        <= extract the main content
        <- raw document
```

---

## Complete Examples

### Example 1: Simple Linear Workflow

**Natural Language**:
```
"Calculate the average of the cleaned numbers after removing outliers from the raw data."
```

**Derivation Output (`.ncds`)**:
```ncds
<- average
    <= calculate the average
    <- cleaned numbers
        <= remove outliers
        <- raw data
```

**Breakdown**:
- **Root**: `average` (final output)
- **Operation 1**: `calculate the average`
- **Input to Op 1**: `cleaned numbers` (intermediate)
- **Operation 2**: `remove outliers`
- **Input to Op 2**: `raw data` (base input)

---

### Example 2: Multiple Inputs

**Natural Language**:
```
"Combine the sentiment scores and entity mentions to generate a comprehensive report."
```

**Derivation Output (`.ncds`)**:
```ncds
<- comprehensive report
    <= generate a comprehensive report
    <- sentiment scores
    <- entity mentions
```

**Breakdown**:
- **Root**: `comprehensive report`
- **Operation**: `generate a comprehensive report`
- **Input 1**: `sentiment scores`
- **Input 2**: `entity mentions`

**Note**: Both inputs are siblings (same indentation level).

---

### Example 3: Branching Workflow

**Natural Language**:
```
"Generate a summary by analyzing both the quantitative data and the qualitative feedback."
```

**Derivation Output (`.ncds`)**:
```ncds
<- summary
    <= generate summary
    <- quantitative analysis
        <= analyze quantitative data
        <- quantitative data
    <- qualitative analysis
        <= analyze qualitative feedback
        <- qualitative feedback
```

**Breakdown**:
- Both branches compute independently
- Root combines their results

---

### Example 4: Conditional Logic

**Natural Language**:
```
"If the validation passes, use the processed result, otherwise use the fallback value."
```

**Derivation Output (`.ncds`)**:
```ncds
<- final result
    <= select the first valid option
    <- processed result
        <= process the input if validation passes
        <- input data
    <- fallback value
```

**Note**: Conditional logic typically uses selection operators (introduced in Formalization). At derivation stage, we just structure the options.

---

### Example 5: Iteration

**Natural Language**:
```
"For each document, extract the key entities and collect all results."
```

**Derivation Output (`.ncds`)**:
```ncds
<- all extracted entities
    <= for each document
    <- extracted entities
        <= extract key entities
        <- document
    <* documents
```

**Key features**:
- Loop concept: `for each document`
- Per-iteration result: `extracted entities`
- Loop base: `documents` (marked with `<*`)

## Natural Language Patterns

### Common Patterns and Their Structure

| NL Pattern | `.ncds` Structure |
|------------|------------------|
| "A then B" | B depends on A (A is child of B) |
| "Combine A and B" | Both A and B are sibling inputs |
| "For each X, do Y" | Loop structure with `<*` |
| "If condition, use A else B" | Selection with A and B as options |
| "Extract X from Y" | Y is input to extraction operation |
| "Calculate X using Y and Z" | Y and Z are sibling inputs |

### Temporal Indicators

Words that indicate order:
- "after", "before", "then", "following", "preceding"
- "first X, then Y" → X before Y
- "once X is complete, do Y" → X → Y

### Data Flow Indicators

Words that indicate dependencies:
- "using", "from", "based on", "with", "given"
- "analyze X using Y" → Y is input
- "extract X from Y" → Y is input

---

## Derivation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Top-Down (Goal-Oriented)

1. Identify final goal (what needs to be produced?)
2. Ask: "What operations produce this?"
3. Ask: "What inputs does that operation need?"
4. Recurse until reaching base inputs

**Example**:

**Goal**: "Generate investment recommendation"

**Questions**:
- What produces recommendation? → `generate recommendation` operation
- What does it need? → `analysis results`
- What produces analysis results? → `analyze signals` operation
- What does it need? → `raw signals`

**Result**:
```ncds
<- investment recommendation
    <= generate recommendation
    <- analysis results
        <= analyze signals
        <- raw signals
```

### Strategy 2: Bottom-Up (Data-Driven)

1. Identify all inputs/data sources
2. Ask: "What can we do with this data?"
3. Chain operations based on capabilities
4. Stop when final goal reached

**Example**:

**Starting data**: "customer reviews"

**Questions**:
- What can we do with reviews? → Filter spam
- What next? → Extract sentiment
- What next? → Aggregate statistics
- Final goal? → Report

**Result**:
```ncds
<- aggregate report
    <= generate report
    <- sentiment statistics
        <= aggregate sentiment
        <- sentiment scores
            <= extract sentiment
            <- clean reviews
                <= filter spam
                <- customer reviews
```

### Strategy 3: Hybrid (Most Common)

1. Identify goal and inputs
2. Work from both ends toward middle
3. Connect when paths meet

**Most practical approach** for complex workflows.

## Derivation with LLMs

### Using LLMs for Derivation

LLMs can assist with or fully automate derivation:

**Prompt Pattern**:
```
Convert this natural language instruction into NormCode .ncds format.

Instruction: [YOUR INSTRUCTION]

Rules:
1. Use <- for data concepts
2. Use <= for operations
3. Use 4-space indentation
4. Read bottom-up (deepest concepts first)
5. Final output at top (root)

Output the .ncds file:
```

**Example Output**:
```ncds
<- final result
    <= compute result
    <- processed input
        <= process input
        <- raw input
```

### Validation After LLM Generation

**Check**:
1. All concepts have proper markers (`<-`, `<=`)
2. Indentation is consistent (4 spaces)
3. Bottom-up reading makes sense
4. No orphaned concepts (all connected to tree)
5. Final output at root (level 0)

---

## Common Derivation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Wrong Execution Order

**Problem**: Putting operations in wrong order.

**Example (Wrong)**:
```ncds
<- analysis
    <= analyze
    <- raw data
        <= clean data
        <- preprocessed data
```

**Why wrong**: Can't clean data that doesn't exist yet. Should be:

**Correct**:
```ncds
<- analysis
    <= analyze
    <- preprocessed data
        <= clean data
        <- raw data
```

### Mistake 2: Missing Intermediate Concepts

**Problem**: Skipping necessary intermediate results.

**Example (Wrong)**:
```ncds
<- summary
    <= summarize
        <= extract content
        <- document
```

**Why wrong**: `extract content` needs to produce an intermediate concept that `summarize` uses.

**Correct**:
```ncds
<- summary
    <= summarize
    <- extracted content
        <= extract content
        <- document
```

### Mistake 3: Unclear Dependencies

**Problem**: Multiple possible interpretations.

**Example (Ambiguous)**:
```ncds
<- result
    <= combine
    <- data A
        <= process
        <- input A
    <- data B
        <= process
        <- input B
```

**Issue**: Unclear if both processes run independently or one depends on the other.

**Better**: Add explicit structure or comments.

### Mistake 4: Incorrect Indentation

**Problem**: Wrong hierarchy due to indentation errors.

**Example (Wrong)**:
```ncds
<- result
    <= compute
<- input     # Wrong! Should be indented 8 spaces
```

**Correct**:
```ncds
<- result
    <= compute
        <- input
```

### Mistake 5: Wrong Concept Order (Dependencies After Dependents)

**Problem**: Writing concepts in wrong order causes incorrect flow index assignment.

**Example (Wrong)**:
```ncds
<- {result}
    <= select first valid
    
    /: Options listed before conditions - WRONG!
    <- {option A}
        <= do A
            <= when condition holds
            <* <is type A>
    
    <- <is type A>       ← Condition comes AFTER it's used!
        <= check type
        <- {type}
```

**Why wrong**: The condition `<is type A>` gets a higher flow index than `{option A}`, but the condition must be evaluated BEFORE the timing gate can use it.

**Correct**:
```ncds
<- {result}
    <= select first valid
    
    /: Conditions first, then options
    <- <is type A>       ← Condition evaluated FIRST
        <= check type
        <- {type}
    
    <- {option A}        ← Option executed AFTER condition
        <= do A
            <= when condition holds
            <* <is type A>
```

**Rule**: Within any scope, write concepts in execution order. Dependencies must be resolved before they're used.

### Mistake 6: Missing Explicit Input References

**Problem**: Operators (grouping, specification, loops) don't have explicit input declarations.

**Example (Wrong)**:
```ncds
<- {all data}
    <= bundle all information
    /: Missing explicit input references!
```

**Why wrong**: The operator doesn't know what inputs to consume. This causes runtime errors like "empty reference" or "missing assign_source".

**Correct**:
```ncds
<- {all data}
    <= bundle all information
    <- {data A}
    <- {data B}
    <- {data C}
```

**Rule**: Every operator must have explicit child value concepts for each input it consumes.

### Mistake 7: Forgetting Return Operations in Loops

**Problem**: Loop body doesn't specify what gets collected.

**Example (Wrong)**:
```ncds
<- [all results]
    <= for each item
    <- {result}
        <= process item
        <- {item}
    <* [items]
```

**Why wrong**: The looper doesn't know what to collect and aggregate.

**Correct**:
```ncds
<- [all results]
    <= for each item
        <= return result for this iteration    ← RETURN OPERATION
        <- {result}
            <= process item
            <- {item}
    <- [items]
    <* {current item}
```

**Rule**: Loops need an explicit return operation that wraps the per-iteration result.

## Derivation Comments

### Using Derivation Comments

During derivation, you can add comments to guide the process:

| Comment | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `...:` | Source text (un-decomposed) | `...: Calculate the sum of all digits` |
| `?:` | Question guiding decomposition | `?: What operation should be performed?` |
| `/:` | Description (complete) | `/: This computes the final total` |

**Example**:
```ncds
<- digit sum
    ...: Calculate the sum of all digits
    ?: What's the operation?
    <= calculate sum
    /: This computes the final total
    <- all digits
```

**These comments**:
- Document the derivation process
- Help LLMs understand intent
- Preserved through compilation
- Can be removed in final `.ncd`

---

## Derivation vs. Formalization

### What Derivation Does

- ✅ Extracts structure and hierarchy
- ✅ Identifies concepts and operations
- ✅ Orders dependencies

### What Derivation Does NOT Do

- ❌ Assign flow indices (that's Formalization)
- ❌ Determine sequence types (that's Formalization)
- ❌ Add semantic types (`{}`, `[]`, etc.) (that's Formalization)
- ❌ Configure execution (that's Post-Formalization)

**Derivation focuses on WHAT, not HOW.**

---

## Next Steps

After derivation, your `.ncds` file moves to:

- **[Formalization](formalization.md)** - Add flow indices, sequence types, and semantic types

---

## Derivation Takeaways: Lessons from Examples

The following insights are synthesized from verified working examples (see `documentation/current/4_compilation/examples/ncds/`).

### 1. Derivation Expresses Computational Structure, Not Control Flow

Traditional programming uses explicit control flow (`if`, `for`, `while`). NormCode derivation instead expresses **data dependencies** and **structural relationships**. The "control flow" emerges from how data flows.

| Traditional | NormCode Derivation |
|-------------|---------------------|
| `for item in list:` | `<= for every item` + `<* list` |
| `if condition:` | `<= if condition` + `<* condition` |
| `while not done:` | Conditional append stops the loop |
| `x = f(y, z)` | `<- x` with `<= f` and children `<- y`, `<- z` |

**Insight**: Don't think "how do I loop?" Think "what collection am I iterating, and what result do I produce per item?"

---

### 2. Loops Have Explicit Return Operations

NormCode loops have a specific structure:

1. **A collection to aggregate into** (e.g., `[all results]`)
2. **A loop operator** (e.g., `<= for each item`)
3. **A return operation** (e.g., `<= return result for this item`)
4. **The per-iteration result** (e.g., `{result}`)
5. **The collection to iterate over** (e.g., `[items]`)
6. **The loop context variable** (e.g., `<* {current item}`)

**Loop Structure**:
```ncds
<- [all results]
    <= for each item in collection
        <= return result for this item        ← RETURN OPERATION
        /: Specifies what gets aggregated into [all results]
        
        <- {result}                           ← What gets returned
            <= process the item
            <- {current item}
    
    <- [items]                                ← Collection to iterate
    <* {current item}                         ← Loop context variable
```

**The return operation** is crucial:
- It wraps the per-iteration computation
- It tells the looper what to collect and aggregate
- Without it, the looper doesn't know what to join

**Self-Seeding Loops** (Chat Session example):
```ncds
<- on-going messages
    <= append current message
        <= if session should NOT end
        <* session should end?
    <- current message
```

Starts empty, but `start_without_value: true` lets iteration begin.

**Takeaway**: Loops need an explicit return operation that wraps the per-iteration result.

---

### 3. Conditionals Are Timing Gates, Not Branches

NormCode doesn't have traditional if-else branches. Instead:

1. **Judgements produce boolean concepts** (`<>` type)
2. **Timing gates enable/disable operations** (`@:'` = if true, `@:!` = if NOT true)
3. **Multiple branches can coexist**, each gated by its condition

**Example (Investment Decision)**:
```ncds
<- bullish recommendation
    <= generate buy recommendation
        <= if signals surpass expectations    ← timing gate
        <* signals surpass?

<- bearish recommendation
    <= generate sell recommendation
        <= if signals deviate from expectations
        <* signals deviate?
```

**Both branches exist in the plan**. Only the applicable one produces a result.

**Takeaway**: Think "which conditions enable which operations?" not "which branch do I take?"

---

### 4. State Lives in Axes, Not Variables

Traditional mutable state (`carry = carry + 1`) doesn't exist. Instead:

1. **Axis dimensions track state** (e.g., `carry-over number` axis)
2. **Previous iteration state referenced via `*-1`** (e.g., `{carry}<$({carry})*-1>`)
3. **Ground concepts provide initial values** (e.g., `reference_data: ["%(0)"]`)

**Example (Addition Algorithm)**:
```ncds
<- carry-over
    <= update from previous
    ...
<^ carry with previous value    ← references *-1 iteration
```

**Takeaway**: "Updating a variable" becomes "producing a new value on the next axis slice."

---

### 5. The Three Essential Markers

Every `.ncds` derivation uses just three markers:

| Marker | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `<-` | **Value Concept** | Any data: inputs, outputs, intermediates |
| `<=` | **Functional Concept** | Any operation: LLM call, computation, selection |
| `<*` | **Context Concept** | Loop base, judgement condition, timing reference |

**Advanced patterns add**:
- `<^` — Carry-over state from previous iteration
- Comments (`/:`, `?:`, `...:`) — Documentation

**Takeaway**: If you're stuck, ask: "Is this data (`<-`), an operation (`<=`), or context (`<*`)?"

---

### 6. Execution Order Principle: First-Executed, First-Written

**The Core Rule**: Within any scope, concepts that execute first should be written first.

This applies at every level of the hierarchy:
- **Under the root**: Ground concepts first, then Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3...
- **Within a loop**: Judgements first, then conditions, then gated operations
- **Within a selection**: First check conditions, then list options

**Single Root Structure**:

Every `.ncds` file has ONE root concept with everything nested under it:

```ncds
:<:{goal}
    <= return the final result
    
    /: GROUND CONCEPTS (inputs - exist before anything runs)
    <- {input file}
    
    /: PHASE 1 (executed first)
    <- {phase 1 output}
        <= do phase 1 work
        <- {input file}
    
    /: PHASE 2 (executed second, depends on phase 1)
    <- {phase 2 output}
        <= do phase 2 work
        <- {phase 1 output}
    
    /: PHASE 3 (executed last, depends on phase 2)
    <- {phase 3 output}
        <= do phase 3 work
        <- {phase 2 output}
```

**Within a Conditional Selection**:

```ncds
<- {result}
    <= select first valid option
    
    /: STEP 1: Judge type (executed first)
    <- {type}
        <= judge the type
        <- {input}
    
    /: STEP 2: Check conditions (executed second)
    <- <is type A>
        <= check if type equals A
        <- {type}
    
    <- <is type B>
        <= check if type equals B
        <- {type}
    
    /: STEP 3: Apply matching operation (executed third, timing-gated)
    <- {option A result}
        <= do operation A
            <= when condition holds
            <* <is type A>
        <- {input}
    
    <- {option B result}
        <= do operation B
            <= when condition holds
            <* <is type B>
        <- {input}
```

**Why This Matters**:

The orchestrator assigns flow indices based on position in the file. Concepts written earlier get lower flow indices and execute first. This ensures:

1. Dependencies are resolved before they're needed
2. Conditions are evaluated before timing gates check them
3. The execution order matches the reading order

**Takeaway**: Write concepts in the order they should execute. First things first.

---

### 7. Grouping Creates Structure, Not Just Collections

The `&` operator doesn't just collect items — it creates **labeled, structured output**:

| Pattern | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `<= bundle A, B, C` | Dictionary-like `{A: ..., B: ..., C: ...}` |
| `<= collect X across Y` | Array collected along Y axis |
| `<= group signals` | New axis dimension for unified access |

**Example (Investment Decision)**:
```ncds
<- all recommendations
    <= bundle bullish, bearish, and neutral recommendations
    <- bullish recommendation
    <- bearish recommendation
    <- neutral recommendation
```

**Takeaway**: Use grouping to create structured outputs that downstream operations can access by name.

---

### 8. LLM Calls vs. Python Scripts

NormCode supports both **LLM-based** and **deterministic** operations:

| Type | Syntax | Use When |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Imperative** `({})` | `<= generate summary` | LLM decision-making |
| **Judgement** `<{}>` | `<= judge if X` | LLM boolean evaluation |
| **Python** | `imperative_python` | Exact computation (math, parsing) |

**The Addition Algorithm uses Python** because arithmetic must be exact:
```ncds
<- remainder
    <= get remainder of digit sum divided by 10    ← Python script
    <- digit sum
```

**Takeaway**: Use LLM for ambiguous reasoning; use Python for deterministic computation.

---

### 9. Comments Are First-Class Documentation

Good `.ncds` includes comments that:
- **Explain intent** (`/: This checks if user wants to quit`)
- **Document patterns** (`/: Self-seeding loop starts empty`)
- **Note the formal syntax** (`/: @:! = execute if NOT true`)

**Example**:
```ncds
<- session should end?
    <= judge if user wants to end session
    /: Produces <> (proposition) type
    /: Used as timing gate for append operation
    <- current message
```

**Takeaway**: Write comments for your future self and for LLMs that will process the plan.

---

### 10. Pattern Recognition Beats Syntax Memorization

The same small set of patterns appears across all examples:

| Pattern | Examples Using It |
|---------|-------------------|
| Linear chain | 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07 |
| Multiple inputs | 02, 05, 06, 07 |
| Iteration | 01, 03, 06, 07 |
| Conditional append | 01, 07 |
| Judgement + timing gate | 01, 04, 06, 07 |
| Grouping/bundling | 01, 05, 06, 07 |
| Nested loops | 07 |
| Carry-over state | 07 |

**Takeaway**: Learn the patterns, not the syntax. The syntax follows naturally once you recognize which pattern applies.

### Quick Reference: Choosing the Right Pattern

| If you need to... | Use this pattern |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Transform A into B | Linear chain: B depends on A |
| Combine multiple inputs | Sibling children under operation |
| Process each item in a collection | Iteration with `<*` |
| Keep going until done | Self-seeding loop + conditional append |
| Do A or B based on condition | Judgement + timing gates |
| Bundle related outputs | Grouping (`&`) |
| Carry state between iterations | Axis reference (`%^` / `*-1`) |
| Execute after something completes | Timing dependency (`@.`) |

### Quick Reference: Ordering Principles

| Scope | Order |
|-------|-------|
| **Under root** | Ground concepts → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → ... |
| **Within a phase** | Dependencies before dependents |
| **Within a selection** | Judgement → Conditions → Timing-gated options |
| **Within a loop** | Loop body → Loop input → Loop context (`<*`) |

**The Rule**: First-executed, first-written. Write concepts in execution order.

### Quick Reference: Explicit References Checklist

| Operator Type | Required Explicit Inputs |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| **Grouping** (`&`) | All items to bundle as child `<-` concepts |
| **Loop** (`*.`) | Return operation, input collection, context variable |
| **Specification** (`$.`) | Source concept as child `<-` |
| **Selection** (`$@`) | All options as child `<-` concepts |
| **Imperative** | All input data as child `<-` concepts |

**The Rule**: Never assume implicit inputs. Every operator must explicitly declare what it consumes.

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

| Concept | Insight |
|---------|---------|
| **Natural language → Structure** | Derivation extracts explicit hierarchy from ambiguous text |
| **First-executed, first-written** | Write concepts in execution order within each scope |
| **Single root structure** | Everything under one root; phases listed in order |
| **Three markers** | `<-` (data), `<=` (operations), `<*` (context) |
| **Four-space indentation** | Hierarchy through indentation |
| **LLM-friendly** | Both humans and LLMs can write `.ncds` |
| **Patterns over syntax** | Learn the 10 patterns; syntax follows naturally |
| **Control via data flow** | Loops and conditionals emerge from dependencies |
| **Explicit references** | Every operator must explicitly list its inputs |

### The Derivation Promise

**Derivation makes intent explicit**:

1. Ambiguous natural language becomes structured hierarchy
2. Dependencies are clear and traceable
3. Ready for formalization into rigorous `.ncd`

**Result**: A plan that captures WHAT needs to happen, ready to specify HOW it happens.
